Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
**Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices

Software aengineering encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance, and project management. In software engineering, the focuses is in creating reliable, efficient, maintainable, and scalable software systems that meet user needs and comply with quality standards and regulations.
Whereas traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks with little emphasis on formal processes and broader project management practices.

**Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.**
Requirement Gathering and analysis - This is usually the first phase in software development cycle. At this phase the user needs and system requirments are collected. This is achieved through administration of questionnaires, interviews and analysing already existing systems.
System design - At this phase phase the team comes up with the blue print of the system. It is at this stage that the databases, user interfaces, system modules and components are designed.
Implementation - At this stage the designs are converted into executable codes using the appropriate code and adhering to to the set coding rules and guidelines.
Testing - At this stage the software is tested to see if its functioning as intended and if their are any bugs. There are various testing levels such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Its at this stage that bugs are identified and fixed.
Deployment - After testing the software is availed for use. It is deployed in the production everonment. It may involve installation, configuration and running deployment scripts.
maintainance - at this stage regular updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback and changing requirements are performed. Routine maintenance tasks are conducted to ensure performance and reliability. This is aimed to ensure that the system remains functional and relevant over time

**Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?**
Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach which emphasizes on flexibility, customer collaboration and rapid delivery of small functional modules of a software whereas waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach which emphasizes on a structured and distinct non overlapping phases.

Waterfall
The approach is linear, structured and sequential
Customer involvement is very low. It is only there during the initial requirements phase.
This model is not flexible. The requirements are usually fixed from initial stages.
The development phases are distinct and sequential
Documentation is extensive on each developmental phase
Issues are mainly identified at later stages causing higher costs of fixing

Agile
The approach is usually iterative, flexible and adaptive
Customer involvement is usually high with continuous feedback and collaboration
It is highly flexible, therefore accommodates changing requirements
The development phase is usually iterative and overlap
Minimal documentation with major focus on a working software
Issues are identified at early stages since the process of identifying is usually continuous, helping in early resolution

Preferred Scenarios
Waterfall Model is preferred where :
	A project has well defined and stable requirements
	Documentation and traceability is critical
	The teams prefer a structured and predictable approach
	Projects have a regulatory or compliance requirement
Agile model is preferred where:
	Projects have frequently changing requirements
	Customer involvement and feedback is crucial
	Where rapid delivery of functional modules is needed
	The teams are experienced and capable of self-management

**Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.**
Requirements engineering is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that involves the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. 
Process:
Requirements Elicitation – This process involves gathering information from various stakeholders through administering questionnaires, interviews, surveys and workshops, observing users and studying existing systems and documentations. The initial list of both functional and non-functional requirements is derived here.
Requirements Analysis – The gathered information is analyzed and refined for clarity, feasibility and completeness. At this stage conflicts are identified requirements are prioritized and they are made sure to be realistic and achievable. The requirement are visualizes using flow diagrams, use case diagrams, etc.
Requirements Specification – A software Requirements Specification (SRC) document is developed. It is a detailed and formal requirements detail. It contains functional and non-functional requirements, constraints and assumptions.
Requirements Validation – The documented requirements are checked to accurately represent the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. The requirements are reviewed together with the stakeholders, walkthroughs are performed and validation meetings conducted. Prototypes maybe used to confirm understanding.
Requirements Management – Handles all the requirements changes throughout the lifecycle. The changes are tracked, managed, traced and updated.

**_Importance of Requirement Engineering_**
It provides a clear and detailed blueprint for the design and development phases. Well-defined requirements ensure that developers understand what needs to be built, reducing ambiguities and misinterpretations.
Stakeholders are involved from initial stages and throughout the requirements engineering process, ensuring accurate captured of their needs. This helps in building a product that meets user expectations and business goals.
Identifying and resolving requirement conflicts and ambiguities early in the process helps mitigate risks that could arise later in the project. It reduces the chances of costly rework and project delays.
Clear and well-documented requirements help in defining the project scope. It provides a basis for estimating effort, time, and cost, and helps in managing scope creep by controlling changes to the requirements.
Requirements engineering lays the groundwork for testing and quality assurance. Clear requirements make it easier to develop test cases and ensure that the final product meets the specified requirements.
Documentation and validation of requirements improve communication among project team members and stakeholders. It ensures everyone has a common understanding of what the software should do and the constraints it must operate within.
Well-documented requirements provide a reference for future maintenance and enhancements. They help in understanding the initial design decisions and the rationale behind them, making it easier to make changes and add new features.

**Software Design Principles:**
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into discrete, independent components or modules, each responsible for a specific part of the system's functionality. Each module encapsulates a portion of the system's behavior and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces. This design principle aims to improve the organization, development, and maintenance of software systems.

**How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Maintainability:**
•	Reduced Complexity: By breaking down the system into smaller, manageable pieces, the overall complexity of the system is reduced. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs, add new features, and understand the system's structure.
•	Isolation of Responsibilities: Each module has a clear responsibility, making it easier to pinpoint where changes or fixes need to be made. This also reduces the risk of unintended side effects when modifying code.
•	Version Control: Modules can be versioned independently, allowing for more controlled and manageable updates. This is especially useful in large systems where different modules may need to evolve at different paces.
Scalability:
•	Parallel Processing: Modular systems can take advantage of parallel processing, where different modules can run on different threads or processors, improving overall performance.
•	Distributed Systems: Modules can be deployed across different servers or environments, allowing the system to scale horizontally. This is particularly useful in cloud-based or micro services architectures.
•	Incremental Growth: New functionality can be added incrementally by developing new modules or enhancing existing ones without requiring a complete overhaul of the system. This allows the system to grow and adapt over time in a controlled manner.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Unit testing - focuses on testing individual components or units of code, typically functions or methods, in isolation from the rest of the system. To verify that each unit of the software performs as expected. Examples of tools used include JUnit (Java), NUnit (C#), and pytest (Python).
 Integration testing - focuses on testing the interaction between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as expected. It focuses on identifying issues that arises during integration of units such as interface mismatches or data exchange problems. This type of testing can either be done incrementally or all at once. Tools used include JUnit, NUnit, and Selenium.
System testing - involves testing the complete, integrated system to verify that it meets the specified requirements. Various types of system testing are done include functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and usability testing. Tools that are used in this testing include Selenium, JMeter, and LoadRunner.
Acceptance testing – This is the final level of testing performed to determine whether the system meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment. It is carried out by end users against real world scenarios. Types of acceptance testing may include Alpha for controlled environment and beta for real world environments. Tools that maybe used include Jira, testrails, Manual testing.
Importance of Testing
• Quality Assurance: Testing ensures that the software meets the required quality standards, delivering a product that functions correctly and reliably.
• Bug Identification and Fixing: Identifying and fixing bugs early in the development process helps prevent costly and time-consuming issues later.
• Verification and Validation: Testing verifies that the software meets the specified requirements (verification) and validates that it meets the user's needs and expectations (validation).
• Security: Testing helps identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses, ensuring that the software is secure against potential threats and attacks.
• Performance Optimization: Performance testing identifies bottlenecks and areas for improvement, ensuring that the software performs well under various conditions.
• Customer Satisfaction: Delivering high-quality, reliable software enhances user satisfaction and trust, leading to better adoption and retention.
• Compliance: Ensuring that the software complies with industry standards, regulations, and best practices.
• Risk Mitigation: Testing helps mitigate risks associated with software failures, reducing the likelihood of severe issues in production.


**What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.**
Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code or other collections of files over time. They enable multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, keep track of changes, and maintain the history of every modification made.
Importance
Collaboration - VCS allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Changes from different developers can be merged systematically.
History and Tracking - Every change made to the code is tracked, along with who made the change and why. This historical record is invaluable for understanding the evolution of a project and for debugging issues by looking at the history of changes.
Branching and Merging - Developers can create branches to work on new features or fixes in isolation from the main codebase. These branches can later be merged back into the main branch, allowing for organized development workflows.
Backup and Recovery - VCS serve as a backup system for the codebase. If something goes wrong, previous versions of the code can be restored easily.
Code Integrity and Quality - VCS can help maintain code integrity by providing mechanisms for code reviews and automated testing workflows, ensuring that only quality code is integrated into the main codebase.
Deployment and Release Management - VCS facilitate the process of tagging and releasing different versions of the software, making it easier to manage deployments and rollbacks.
